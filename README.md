* `LyelPayElements`: The main component that renders the Lyel Pay payment form.
* `apiKey`: The API key to use for the Lyel Pay payment form.
* `amount`: The amount to be paid.
* `clientSecret`: The client secret to use for the Lyel Pay payment form.
* `onPaymentInitiate`: A callback function that is called when the payment is initiated.
